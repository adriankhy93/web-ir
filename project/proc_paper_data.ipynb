Among the payoff matrix quantifying the result of a social interaction, the interaction conditions have been varied, such as the number of repeated interactions, the number of interaction partners, the possibility to punish defective behavior etc. While an extension to spatial interactions has been considered early on such as in the \"game of life\", recent studies have focussed on effects of the structure of social interaction networks.\\n  However, the possibility of individuals to move and, thereby, evade areas with a high level of defection, and to seek areas with a high level of cooperation, has not been fully explored so far. This contribution presents a model combining game theoretical interactions with success-driven motion in space, and studies the consequences that this may have for the degree of cooperation and the spatio-temporal dynamics in the population. It is demonstrated that the combination of game theoretical interactions with motion gives rise to many self-organized behavioral patterns on an aggregate level, which can explain a variety of empirically observed social behaviors.',\n",

This assumption leads such strategies to be ineffective in the real-world performance-changing scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal game approach for heterogeneous vehicular network selection under conditions in which the performance parameters of some networks are changing. Terminals attempting to switch to the network with higher evaluation is formulated as a multi-play non-cooperative game. Heterogeneous vehicular network characteristics are thoroughly accounted for to adjust the game strategy and adapt to the vehicular environment for stability and rapid convergence. A multi-play non-cooperative game model is built to formulate network selection. A probabilistic strategy is used to gradually drive players toward convergence to prevent instability. Furthermore, a system prototype was built at the Connected and Automated Vehicle Test bed of Chang'an University (CAVTest). Its corresponding test results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively suppress the ping-pong effect caused by massive handoffs due to varying network performance and thus well outperforms the single-play strategy.\",\n",

We show that several concepts including the quantum chromatic number and the Kochen-Specker sets that arose from different contexts fit naturally in the binary constraint system framework. The structure and complexity of the quantum satisfiability problems for these constraint systems are investigated. Combined with a new construct called the commutativity gadget for each problem, several classic NP-hardness reductions are lifted to their corresponding quantum versions.

       "  'paper_abstract': \"Data sponsoring is a widely-used incentive method in today's cellular networks, where video content providers (CPs) cover part or all of the cellular data cost for mobile users so as to attract more video users and increase data traffic. In the forthcoming 5G cellular networks, edge caching is emerging as a promising technique to deliver videos with lower cost and higher quality. The key idea is to cache video contents on edge networks (e.g., femtocells and WiFi access points) in advance and deliver the cached contents to local video users directly (without involving cellular data cost for users). In this work, we aim to study how the edge caching will affect the CP's data sponsoring strategy as well as the users' behaviors and the data market. Specifically, we consider a single CP who offers both the edge caching service and the data sponsoring service to a set of heterogeneous mobile video users (with different mobility and video request patterns). We formulate the interactions of the CP and the users as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the CP (leader) determines the budgets (efforts) for both services in Stage I, and the users (followers) decide whether and which service(s) they would like to subscribe to. We analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically. Our analysis and experimental results show that by introducing the edge caching, the CP can increase his revenue by 105%.\",\n",

But textureless and specular regions can easily cause failure by making feature matching difficult. Understanding whether an algorithm is robust to these hazardous regions is important. Although many stereo benchmarks have been developed to evaluate performance, it is hard to quantify the effect of hazardous regions in real images because the location and severity of these regions are unknown. In this paper, we develop a synthetic image generation tool enabling to control hazardous factors, such as making objects more specular or transparent, to produce hazardous regions at different degrees. The densely controlled sampling strategy in virtual worlds enables to effectively stress test stereo algorithms by varying the types and degrees of the hazard. We generate a large synthetic image dataset with automatically computed hazardous regions and analyze algorithms on these regions. The observations from synthetic images are further validated by annotating hazardous regions in real-world datasets Middlebury and KITTI (which gives a sparse sampling of the hazards). Our synthetic image generation tool is based on a game engine Unreal Engine 4 and will be open-source along with the virtual scenes in our experiments. Many publicly available realistic game contents can be used by our tool to provide an enormous resource for development and evaluation of algorithms.',\n",

       "  'paper_abstract': \"In high-stake scenarios like medical treatment and auto-piloting, it's risky or even infeasible to collect online experimental data to train the agent. Simulation-based training can alleviate this issue, but may suffer from its inherent mismatches from the simulator and real environment. It is therefore imperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world deployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with respect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus on the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a generative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model during testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the perturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical difficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment uncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing. To solve this issue, we propose a generic method which formalizes the perturbation as an opponent to obtain a two-player zero-sum game, and further show that the Nash Equilibrium corresponds to the robust policy. We prove that, with a polynomial number of samples from the generative model, our algorithm can find a near-optimal robust policy with a high probability. Our method is able to deal with general perturbations under some mild assumptions and can also be extended to more complex problems like robust partial observable Markov decision process, thanks to the game-theoretical formulation.\",\n",

As a corollary, this proves that the promise problem corresponding to the approximation of the nonlocal value to inverse polynomial accuracy is complete for QMIP*, and therefore NEXP-hard. This establishes that nonlocal games are provably harder than classical games without any complexity theory assumptions. Our result also indicates that gap amplification for nonlocal games may be impossible in general and provides a negative evidence for the possibility of the gap amplification approach to the multi-prover variant of the quantum PCP conjecture.',\n",

Tensor codes provide a simple family of combinatorial constructions of locally testable codes that generalize the family of Reed-Muller codes.

       "  'paper_abstract': \"GANs involve training two networks in an adversarial game, where each network's task depends on its adversary. Recently, several works have framed GAN training as an online or continual learning problem. We focus on the discriminator, which must perform classification under an (adversarially) shifting data distribution. When trained on sequential tasks, neural networks exhibit \\\\emph{forgetting}. For GANs, discriminator forgetting leads to training instability. To counter forgetting, we encourage the discriminator to maintain useful representations by adding a self-supervision. Conditional GANs have a similar effect using labels. However, our self-supervised GAN does not require labels, and closes the performance gap between conditional and unconditional models. We show that, in doing so, the self-supervised discriminator learns better representations than regular GANs.\",\n",

In this work we exploit two popular unsupervised learning techniques, adversarial training and self-supervision, and take a step towards bridging the gap between conditional and unconditional GANs. In particular, we allow the networks to collaborate on the task of representation learning, while being adversarial with respect to the classic GAN game. The role of self-supervision is to encourage the discriminator to learn meaningful feature representations which are not forgotten during training. We test empirically both the quality of the learned image representations, and the quality of the synthesized images. Under the same conditions, the self-supervised GAN attains a similar performance to state-of-the-art conditional counterparts. Finally, we show that this approach to fully unsupervised learning can be scaled to attain an FID of 23.4 on unconditional ImageNet generation.',\n",

       "  'paper_abstract': 'While machine learning can myopically reinforce social inequalities, it may also be used to dynamically seek equitable outcomes. In this paper, we formalize long-term fairness in the context of online reinforcement learning. This formulation can accommodate dynamical control objectives, such as driving equity inherent in the state of a population, that cannot be incorporated into static formulations of fairness. We demonstrate that this framing allows an algorithm to adapt to unknown dynamics by sacrificing short-term incentives to drive a classifier-population system towards more desirable equilibria. For the proposed setting, we develop an algorithm that adapts recent work in online learning. We prove that this algorithm achieves simultaneous probabilistic bounds on cumulative loss and cumulative violations of fairness (as statistical regularities between demographic groups). We compare our proposed algorithm to the repeated retraining of myopic classifiers, as a baseline, and to a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that lacks safety guarantees. Our experiments model human populations according to evolutionary game theory and integrate real-world datasets.',\n",

       "  'paper_abstract': \"Federated learning is a popular technology for training machine learning models on distributed data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated learning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that different data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature space. To ensure the data owners' long-term engagement, it is critical to objectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them accordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation metric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV requires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which causes prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value (VerFedSV) based on SV. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable properties for fairness but is also efficient to compute, and can be adapted to both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results verify the fairness, efficiency, and adaptability of VerFedSV.\",\n",

Our proof builds upon the quantum low-degree test of (Natarajan and Vidick, FOCS 2018) and the classical low-individual degree test of (Ji, et al., 2020) by integrating recent developments from (Natarajan and Wright, FOCS 2019) and combining them with the recursive compression framework of (Fitzsimons et al., STOC 2019).\\n  An immediate byproduct of our result is that there is an efficient reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a two-player nonlocal game has entangled value $1$ or at most $1/2$. Using a known connection, undecidability of the entangled value implies a negative answer to Tsirelson's problem: we show, by providing an explicit example, that the closure $C_{qa}$ of the set of quantum tensor product correlations is strictly included in the set $C_{qc}$ of quantum commuting correlations.

       "  'paper_abstract': 'Unsupervised image-to-image translation is a central task in computer vision. Current translation frameworks will abandon the discriminator once the training process is completed. This paper contends a novel role of the discriminator by reusing it for encoding the images of the target domain. The proposed architecture, termed as NICE-GAN, exhibits two advantageous patterns over previous approaches: First, it is more compact since no independent encoding component is required; Second, this plug-in encoder is directly trained by the adversary loss, making it more informative and trained more effectively if a multi-scale discriminator is applied. The main issue in NICE-GAN is the coupling of translation with discrimination along the encoder, which could incur training inconsistency when we play the min-max game via GAN. To tackle this issue, we develop a decoupled training strategy by which the encoder is only trained when maximizing the adversary loss while keeping frozen otherwise. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of NICE-GAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of FID, KID, and also human preference. Comprehensive ablation studies are also carried out to isolate the validity of each proposed component. Our codes are available at https://github.com/alpc91/NICE-GAN-pytorch.',\n",
